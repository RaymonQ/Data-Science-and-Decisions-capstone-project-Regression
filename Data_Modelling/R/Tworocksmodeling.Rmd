## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

Trying to fit into another model which deal with the skewness on the left 
```{r}
library(boot)
set.seed(1) 
#The first component is the raw cross-validation estimate of prediction error. The second component is the adjusted cross-validation estimate. The adjustment is designed to compensate for the bias introduced by not using leave-one-out cross-validation.
cv.glm(train_nt,full.mod1.gau2,K=10)$delta
```





```{r}
library("sn")
#based on the density diagram of log(CPHL), it shows left skewness
#Fitting Linear Models With Skew-Elliptical Error Term  family is skew-normal
selm.mod<-selm(log(CPHL)~.,data=train_nt)
summary(selm.mod)
```

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(selm.mod)
```

  

Analysis


```{r}
library(ModelMetrics)
#calculate the MSE
#response with log and gaussian family
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
#calculate the MSE
plot(density(log(test$CPHL)),xlim = c(-3,2))
plot(density(predict(full.mod1.gau2,newdata=test,type="response")))
pred_gau2<-predict(full.mod1.gau2, test)
data.frame(RMSE = rmse(test$CPHL,pred_gau2),
            MAE = mae(test$CPHL,pred_gau2),
            MSE=mse(test$CPHL,pred_gau2))
```

```{r}
##selm model
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
#calculate the MSE
plot(density(log(test$CPHL)),xlim = c(-3,2))
pred_selm<-predict(selm.mod,test)
plot(density(pred_selm))
data.frame(RMSE = rmse(test$CPHL,pred_selm),
            MAE = mae(test$CPHL,pred_selm),
            MSE = mse(test$CPHL,pred_selm))

```
We see that selm performs similarly with glm model, therefore there is no reason we should use a model that we are not familiar with.
Our final model is 
```{r}
summary(full.mod1.gau2)
#VIF>10, it has multicollinearity
car::vif(full.mod1.gau2)
```
